# Sleepyboi
Sleepyboi is a minimalist, single-file web app for generating high-quality noise to help you sleep, relax, or focus.

## Features
- **White, pink, brown, and violet noise**: Choose your preferred noise color for sleep or concentration.
- **Real-time generation**: No looping artifacts; noise is generated live in your browser.
- **Simple controls**: Adjust volume and filter sliders, or use presets for common noise types.
- **Dark/light mode**: Switch between comfortable themes for day or night use.
- **Mobile-friendly**: Works great on phones and tablets.

## How it works
Sleepyboi uses the Web Audio API to generate noise in real time, with adjustable filters for customizing the sound. All code and UI are contained in a single HTML file for easy deployment—just upload or open `index.html` in your browser.

No tracking, no ads, no dependencies—just pure noise for better sleep.
